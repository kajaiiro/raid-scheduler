            <h3>Information Collection And Use</h3>
            <p>
                While using our Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain
                personally identifiable information that can be used to contact
                or identify you. Personally identifiable information may
                include, but is not limited to your email (&quot;Personal

            <p>
                We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when
                you visit the Site. These companies may use aggregated
                information (not including your name, address, email address or
                telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites
                in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of
                interest to you. If you would like more information about this
                practice and to know your choices about not having this
                information used by these companies, click here.

            <h3>Log Data</h3>
            <p>
                Like many site operators, we use third party services such as
                Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze information
                that your browser sends whenever you visit our Site (&quot;Log
                Data&quot;).
            </p>
            <p>
                This Log Data may include information such as your
                computer&apos;s Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address,
                browser type, browser version, the pages of our Site that you
                visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those
                pages and other statistics.
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
                We use third party advertisements on the Site. Some of these
                advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons
                when they advertise on the Site, which will also send these
                advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program)
                information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you
                used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have
                Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting
                purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New
                York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific
                sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who
                frequents cooking sites).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or
                third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing
                preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security.
                However, this can greatly affect how you are able to interact
                with the Site as well as most other websites.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
                The security of your Personal Information is important to us,
                but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet,
                or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive
                to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal
                Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
            </p>

                any time and you should check this Privacy Policy periodically.
